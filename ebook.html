<h1>Thanks!</h1>

<hr/>

<p>Thanks for your purchase of <em>Build Your Own Lisp</em> in eBook format! I really appreciate your contribution and support.</p>

<p>Shortly you should be receiving an e-mail with your eBook attached. It will be attached as three files in the following formats <code>.epub</code> <code>.mobi</code> <code>.pdf</code>. These are large files and so the e-mail may take some time to download and come through. Don't panic if it doesn't seem to be initially working.</p>

<p>If none of these formats are useful for you please get in contact and I can try to find a format that works well on your e-reader.</p>

<p>If you do not receive this e-mail within the hour, or have trouble opening it or the attachments, please get in contact and I will try to find a way to get you your eBook to you as soon as possible! You can also get in contact if at any point you require an updated version of the book with any fixes that may be merged into the website.</p>
